Building on its successful introduction at Haptics Symposium 2020, the 2022 Haptics Symposium will again feature a IEEE Transactions on Haptics journal track.  Papers accepted to this track will be presented at the conference and simultaneously published as short papers in IEEE Transactions on Haptics. These papers are up to 6 pages in length, including references.

Authors can submit their 6-page paper via the [Transactions on Haptics website](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh/submission-procedures-toh) by selecting the "HAPTICS’22" paper type during the submission process. Papers should be prepared using [the formatting instructions for Short Papers](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh/submission-procedures-toh#shortpapers) provided by the Transactions on Haptics. Each paper will be reviewed by Transactions on Haptics reviewers and an Associate Editor. The outcome of the first round of reviews will be "accept", "revision", or "reject". For papers receiving a decision of “revision” after the first review round, authors will need to submit a revision within 30 days for a second review, which may result in a decision of “accept” or “reject.”  If the decision after the Transactions on Haptics review is “accept,” the paper will be included in the conference and simultaneously published in the journal.

Any papers that receive a decision of “reject” after review by Transactions on Haptics will be evaluated for inclusion by the Haptics Symposium Conference Editorial Board, which will have access to the reviews and Associate Editor’s report.  A paper may therefore be rejected from the journal but accepted for the conference. Such papers will be published in the conference proceedings rather than in the journal.  A paper may also be rejected for publication by both the journal and the conference.  Those papers that are accepted for publication in the journal will be included in the conference, where they will be presented by authors, and will be simultaneously published in the journal.

Authors choosing not to submit via the new journal track may still submit their papers directly to the conference. Such papers will be reviewed following the established conference technical paper review procedure. Accepted conference technical papers will be published in the conference proceedings and IEEE Xplore.

One author of each accepted paper will deliver a talk at the conference and answer questions in any remaining time from the duration that is allotted. Further details will be provided at a later time.

All accepted Transaction on Haptics Short Papers will appear in the Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be distributed at the conference.

Please also note that some links on the Transactions on Haptics website are currently broken. While this issue is being resolved, please find below a copy of the formatting instructions with corrected links:

_If you use LaTeX for preparing a Short Paper, please download the following files for document preparation:_

* _The zipped file pack_ [_ieeeconf.zip_](https://www.ieee-ras.org/images/ieeeconf.zip)_. This contains the LaTeX class file ieeeconf.cls, a sample LaTeX source file root.tex and the compiled document root.pdf._
* _BiBTeX files_ [_IEEEtranBST.zip_](https://2022.hapticssymposium.org/img/IEEEtranBST.zip)
* _Guide to use ieeeconf.cls (based on IEEEtrans.cls)_ [_IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf_](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/files/IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf)
* _The document should be configured for US Letter paper, using the line \documentclass\[letterpaper, 10 pt, conference]{ieeeconf}_

_If you use MSWord for preparing a Short Paper, please download the following files for document preparation_

* _MS Word template_ [_ieeeconf_letter.dot_](https://2022.hapticssymposium.org/img/ieeeconf_letter.dot) _for US Letter paper_
* _Sample Documents_ [_ieeeconf_letter.doc_](https://2022.hapticssymposium.org/img/ieeeconf_letter.doc) _and_ [_sample_A4.doc_](https://2022.hapticssymposium.org/img/cssA4.doc)

_When using the IEEE style format, the first (title) page will contain the paper title and each author's name, affiliation, and full address (mailing address, email address, and fax number), with the corresponding author clearly indicated, the abstract (no more than 200 words), the keywords (index terms), and the beginning of the main text of the paper. Do not use a cover page_

**_Can I submit a video with my paper?_**

Yes, a video can be submitted to the Transactions on Haptics as supplemental material. The only restriction imposed by the Transactions on Haptics is that the total size of all submitted files (including the manuscript and video) does not exceed 48.8 MB. We recommend that you also follow [the video guidelines for Technical Paper submissions](https://2022.hapticssymposium.org/presenting/technical-papers/) so that your video does not need to be modified if it is published in the conference proceedings instead of the journal.

_**Will I need to resubmit my paper to the conference if it is rejected by the journal?**_

All papers that are rejected by the journal after the first or second round of reviews will automatically be sent, along with their reviews, to the Conference Editorial Board (CEB) of the Haptics Symposium to be considered for publication in the conference proceedings and presentation at the conference.

_**Will it be possible for me to submit an extended version of my paper to the Transactions on Haptics at a later date?**_

Short papers that are accepted by the journal will be published in the journal. It will therefore be impossible to publish an extended version of the work in the journal in the future.

Short papers that are rejected by the journal but accepted by the conference will be published in the conference proceedings. It will be possible to extend this work and publish an extended version of the paper in the journal in the future.
