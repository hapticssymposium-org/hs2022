Building on its successful introduction at Haptics Symposium 2020, the 2022 Haptics Symposium will again feature a IEEE Transactions on Haptics journal track.  Papers accepted to this track will be presented at the conference and simultaneously published as short papers in IEEE Transactions on Haptics. These papers are up to 6 pages in length, including references.

Authors can submit their 6-page paper via the [Transactions on Haptics website](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh/submission-procedures-toh) by selecting the "Short paper (ToH-Haptics Symposium 2022)" paper type during the submission process. Papers should be prepared using [the formatting instructions for Short Papers](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/toh/submission-procedures-toh#shortpapers) provided by the Transactions on Haptics. Each paper will be reviewed by Transactions on Haptics reviewers and an Associate Editor. The outcome of the first round of reviews will be "accept", "revision", or "reject". For papers receiving a decision of “revision” after the first review round, authors will need to submit a revision within 30 days for a second review, which may result in a decision of “accept” or “reject.”  If the decision after the Transactions on Haptics review is “accept,” the paper will be included in the conference and simultaneously published in the journal.

Any papers that receive a decision of “reject” after review by Transactions on Haptics will be evaluated for inclusion by the Haptics Symposium Conference Editorial Board, which will have access to the reviews and Associate Editor’s report.  A paper may therefore be rejected from the journal but accepted for the conference. Such papers will be published in the conference proceedings rather than in the journal.  A paper may also be rejected for publication by both the journal and the conference.  Those papers that are accepted for publication in the journal will be included in the conference, where they will be presented by authors, and will be simultaneously published in the journal.

Authors choosing not to submit via the new journal track may still submit their papers directly to the conference. Such papers will be reviewed following the established conference technical paper review procedure. Accepted conference technical papers will be published in the conference proceedings and IEEE Xplore.

One author of each accepted paper will deliver a talk at the conference and answer questions in any remaining time from the duration that is allotted. Further details will be provided at a later time.

All accepted Transaction on Haptics Short Papers will appear in the Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be distributed at the conference.

## **Final Submission**

All accepted Transaction on Haptics Short Papers will appear in this year’s Haptics Symposium proceedings, which will be distributed at the conference.

We will be using the Conference Paper Management System of the Robotics and Automation Society (PaperPlaza) for the creation of the electronic conference program. The authors of accepted ToH Short Papers will use the [PaperPlaza system](https://ras.papercept.net/) to provide information about their paper for inclusion in the conference proceedings. We have provided details below on how to submit your accepted ToH Short Paper content to PaperPlaza.

**Before February 4**, the submitting author must submit a “first submission” for their ToH Short Paper to the “IEEE Trans. Haptics Short Paper” track on [PaperPlaza](https://ras.papercept.net/). The submitting author will be asked to enter the following information:

* The paper title, list of authors, PaperPlaza PIN numbers of all authors, and keywords. An abbreviated abstract for use in the conference program (limited to 750 characters or ~100 words).
* The PDF of the ToH Short Paper and optional accompanying video are not required at this time. These files will be obtained directly from the IEEE Transactions on Haptics for inclusion in the conference proceedings.

Specific questions regarding PaperPlaza should be sent to [ras.101@papercept.net](ras.101@papercept.net). General questions about the final submission of conference technical papers should be sent to the Publications Chair at [publications@hapticssymposium.org](publications@hapticssymposium.org). Urgent general questions should be sent to the Program Chair at [program@hapticssymposium.org](program@hapticssymposium.org) or the General Co-chairs at [chairs@hapticssymposium.org](chairs@hapticssymposium.org).

## **Videos**

Authors of accepted Conference Technical Papers or Transactions on Haptics Short Journal Papers are strongly encouraged to submit each of two types of video: (1) Supplemental Videos (providing information beyond what is included in the paper) and a (2) 30-second Preview Video, to be shared on social media. Submissions are optional, but strongly encouraged as a means of highlighting the paper to interested researchers, including those who may not attend the conference.

### **Supplemental Videos**

As in the past conferences, supplemental videos will be uploaded through the ScholarOne Manuscripts system (Transactions on Haptics Short Journal Papers) or the PaperPlaza system (Technical Papers) and reviewed along with the paper. Videos of the accepted papers will be submitted for publication to IEEE Xplore and may be used to promote the conference.  Authors who submitted videos together with their manuscript need not take any additional action beyond any edits that may be requested by the reviewers and editors.

### **Supplemental Video Requirements**

{{<supplementalVideoList "Journal">}}

### **Preview Videos (new for this year, strongly encouraged)**

Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit a single 30-second preview video summarizing their contribution. The video will significantly increase the visibility of the research to the haptics community and beyond. The 30-second preview videos will be disseminated via social media, including the [IEEE Haptics Symposium YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YjMwrg8Hk6uAtyWb62yAw) and may be used to promote the conference. These preview videos will not be published in IEEE Xplore.

After acceptance, authors should upload their video to their own YouTube account. After uploading, authors must complete the following Preview Video information [form](https://forms.gle/HY1poy2PtheGnF7F8) where they will be requested to provide the video URL.

**The preview video deadline is Feb. 21, 2022.**

### Video Accessibility

When creating videos, please include both captions and voice overs.

Providing alternative means of accessing information is not only valuable for people with sensory impairments, but lets people engage with research materials in a variety of contexts (e.g., if the video is muted). We ask everyone to both have voice and text to explain their videos. To support meeting participants with visual impairments, please describe all figures and images with sufficient detail so that it can be captured in close captioning (see below). 

For Preview Videos, authors may use YouTube’s automatic closed captioning functionality, but are encouraged to review and edit the closed captions after they are generated.

For Supplemental Videos, authors should directly “burn” closed captions into the video, due to technical limitations in IEEE Xplore. In other words, these captions are not provided as a text file, but rather as subtitles in the video itself (this is called “open captioning”, rather than “closed captioning”, because the captions are always visible). 

If you have questions or need assistance with any of these activities, please reach out to the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Chair <mailto:edi@hapticssymposium.org>.

<!--
\_\*\*Can I submit a video with my paper?\*\*\_

Yes, a video can be submitted to the Transactions on Haptics as supplemental material. The only restriction imposed by the Transactions on Haptics is that the total size of all submitted files (including the manuscript and video) does not exceed 48.8 MB. We recommend that you also follow \[the video guidelines for Technical Paper submissions](https://2022.hapticssymposium.org/presenting/technical-papers/) so that your video does not need to be modified if it is published in the conference proceedings instead of the journal.
-->

_**Will I need to resubmit my paper to the conference if it is rejected by the journal?**_

All papers that are rejected by the journal after the first or second round of reviews will automatically be sent, along with their reviews, to the Conference Editorial Board (CEB) of the Haptics Symposium to be considered for publication in the conference proceedings and presentation at the conference.

_**Will it be possible for me to submit an extended version of my paper to the Transactions on Haptics at a later date?**_

Short papers that are accepted by the journal will be published in the journal. It will therefore be impossible to publish an extended version of the work in the journal in the future.

Short papers that are rejected by the journal but accepted by the conference will be published in the conference proceedings. It will be possible to extend this work and publish an extended version of the paper in the journal in the future.
